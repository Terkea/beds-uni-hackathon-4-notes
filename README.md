# beds-uni-hackathon-4-notes
[Task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gclikkec/beds-uni-hackathon-4/master/scenarios/are-you-taking-notes.md)

## Description
Considering the broad variety of gadgets students have such as smart-phones, tablets, laptops, etc and the fact that
the operating systems may range from one to another I decided that the most fitting scenario to make everybody 
happy would be to create a web app out of the task.

My intentions for this project are:
 - To make it as secure as possible so nobody could toy around with your precious notes
 - User-friendly with an intuitive interface to facilitate the new users to join the platform

I have chosen to use a `client-server architecture` with a `Model-View-Controller pattern` because it 
makes the whole app easier to scale and maintain.
